    "During my summer internship at a startup in India, I encountered one of the problems mentioned in the white paper by Domino. The paper states it as : \"Solve the right problem, but didn't realise it had already been solved or can't reproduce it.\". I observed that the projects inside the company did not have the proper documentation for the code used. The only accessible data was the output of the whole projects in terms of insight or a metric that was tracked by a new dashboard. There was no way to access the thinking throughout the project which ###. I believe this is a drawback of chasing the problem in a competitive and timed environment. Data science being an analysis tool for the company and not the actual sellable product led to the company treating it for quick insights and directions to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure there will be multiple times, when someone working on a different project can take help of already run projects and use part of the thinking and intermediate insights. One such case happened with me where I recreated the whole module to determine an attribute regarding the user of the product only to realise that this was already been done in some other project. Another problem that arises here is the absence of properly documented insights that might have appeared during the intermediate steps. The individualistic attention that a project gets tends to dictate the structure and collection formats of the data that might also lead to problems if the same data is used for some other kind of application."

    "When regularising linear regression either in the case of Ridge or in Lasso, a penalty is applied on the size of the cofficients. These methods are also called Shrinkage methods as the coefficient shrink towards zero and towards each other. In the absence of standardisation in the form of scaling, the shrinking will not be fair. There will be different contributions to the penalised terms from both independent variables having different scales. To avoid such kinds of problems, the independent variables are scaled before performing regularised regression."
